# 1.1 Aircraft components

## 1.1.1 The airplane

The Canadian Aviation Regulations (Règlement de l'aviation canadien): “a power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft deriving its lift in flight from aerodynamic reactions on surfaces that remain fixed under given conditions of flight”.

## 1.1.2 Parts of an airplane

5 major parts:

1. The fuselage or body
2. The wings or lifting surfaces
3. The tail section (empennage), or canard
4. The propulsion system: engines, w/o propeller(s)
5. Undercarriage or landing gear.

1. ***The fuselage/ le fuselage/ 机身***

**Truss type:**

**Longerons** run vertically to form the principle member of the fuselage.

Parallel: **N-Girder**

Jointing from parallel: **Warren Truss**

**Monocoque:**

Leaded by a **bulkhead**, cover by **stressed skin**: to provide the covering and form the shape, also capable of carrying loads without any internal bracing.

 Modern days aircraft use **composites** in their construction, to allow assembly of complicated fuselages.

**Semi-monocoque:**

The use of monocoque with **formers** and **stringers**.

2. ***The wing/ l’aile/ 机翼***

Due to its positioning, the wings are referred as “primary lifting surfaces”.

Monoplanes: Airplanes with one pair of wings.

| Wing type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Rectangular | Broussard |
| Tapered | Cessna |
| Elliptical | Split Fire |
| Delta | Concorde |

**Spars:** runs from the **wing root** to the **wing tip**, are the main component of the wing, carry most of the load. Spars intend to stiffen the wings against torsion or twisting.

**Ribs:** Cambered to form an airfoil section to give the shape of the wing and provide a framework to the covering. It can be classified to **web rib** and **truss rib**.

**Compression struts:**  placed at the intervals between the front and rear spars, usually are **steer tubes**.

**Drag** and **anti-drag wires**  runs diagonally from the front to the rear spars, to take drag and anti-drag loads, to further prevent internal bracing.

**Wing bracing struts** protect the wings from external bracing, which root from the fuselage to the mid-section of the wing.  Wings made without external struts called **cantilever** wings (most commercial planes).

**Ailerons:** Surfaces at the airfoil section, hinged to the trailing edge of the wing for purpose of **lateral control**. They usually hinged to the rear spar.

![https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/ailerons%20and%20flaps.jpg?raw=true](https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/ailerons%20and%20flaps.jpg?raw=true)

**Flaps** are hinged to the rear spars, provides similar function to ailerons (Ch 2.1).

**Wing tip bow** are normally a tube, out-streaming  the wing tip to provide a particular shape (eg. rounded), if required.

**Winglet** is a small nearly vertical structure at the wing tip. It incorporated within the wing in some modern airplanes and effective in reducing induced drag (Ch 2.1).

![https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/winglets.jpg?raw=true](https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/winglets.jpg?raw=true)

The **chord** is an imaginary straight line which joining the **leading** and the **trailing edge** of the wing, at the centre section. The m**ean aerodynamic chord (MAC)** is the average chord of the wing.

3. ***The tail section or empennage/ la queue ou l’empennage, the canard/ le canard***

![https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/Empennage.jpg?raw=true](https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/Empennage.jpg?raw=true)

The **horizontal stabiliser/tailplane** is placed at the end of the fuselage to **balance** the aircraft and provide **longitudinal stability**.

The **elevator** hinged on the trailing edge of the stabiliser to give **longitudinal control**. The **stabilator** replaces the combination of horizontal stabiliser and elevator, in some small aircrafts.

The **vertical stabiliser/fin** is a fixed vertical surface to provide **directional stability**, as well as to compensate the effect of **corkscrew motion** of the slip-stream from the **revolving propeller**.

A **rudder** is a movable surface hinged to give **directional control**.

A **trim tab** maybe hinged on movable surfaces (ailerons, rudders, elevators) or fixed surfaces to allow the pilot to trim the motion of the aircraft.

In some modern design planes, the **canard** replaces the horizontal stabiliser. Instead, it is hinged at the **front (in front of the wings)** of the airplane to provide the same function, such as Concord and Piaggio P180.

4. ***The propulsion system/ le système de propulsion/ 推进系统***

Common types of engine: propellers, jet engine, turboprop engine...

**Cowling:** to protect the engine and provide cooling by ducting cooling air around the engine.

**Engine mountings**  support the engine. Together with the spongy **engine mounting bushes**, it absorbs vibration from the engine and prevent it being transmitted to the fuselage.

![https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/engine%20mounting.jpg?raw=true](https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/engine%20mounting.jpg?raw=true)

Made of heavy stainless steel, or a sandwich of asbestos between two dural sheets, the **firewall** separates the engine and the main structure. The fuel tank must **behind** the firewall. The **fuel tanks** can be installed in the wings or in the fuselage (Ch 3.2).

5. ***Landing gear or undercarriage/ train d’atterrissage ou châssis/ 起落架***

Functions of landing gears: 

1. Absorb shock
2. support weight
3. enable ground manoeuvres

**Fixed undercarriage:**

Tricycle gear can be classified into **split** **axle**, **tripod**, **single** **spring** **leaf** **cantilever spring steel**, and **single** **strut**.

| Class | Features |
| --- | --- |
| Split axle | Split from the centre, usually has elastic shock bungee cords, and a strut to bear side loads. |
| Tripod | Consists of three members: two rigid and one oleo lag to form a triangle. When landing, the oleo lag could shortening its length and the whole assembly to spread out, to absorb loads until the springs, rubber discs etc. to take the weight. |
| Single leaf cantilever spring steel | Consists of only one single strap chrome vanadium steel bent directly from the fuselage by cradle bulkheads to from the shape of the complete structure. Low maintenance, simplicity and long service life. |
| Single strut | Single leg or strut extending downward  from its attachment. Usually incorporates with a hydraulic cylinder or rubber biscuits to absorb shocks. |

**Retractable gear:**

Most retractable gears are **cantilever**, being a single **oleo** **lag**, without external bracing. 

**Nosewheel vs tailwheel**

Depends on the position of the **third steerable wheel**, when it is positioned at the front (most modern airplanes), it is called a **tricycle gear configuration**. When it is positioned at the tail, it is referred as a **tailwheel** **configuration**. 

Advances of tricycle gear configuration:

1. Reduced **nose-over tendency**
2. Reduced **ground-looping tendency**
3. Increased **on-ground visibility**
4. Greater **on-ground manoeuvrability under high wind** condition, due to **negative-angle attack** of the wings
5. Greater **on-ground controllability in cross-wind**
6. Easier to learn

Advances of tailwheel configuration:

1. Less **parasite drag** due to **smaller size**
2. Cheaper and easier to build and maintain
3. Broke tailwheel is u**nlikely to cause huge damage**
4. **Easier to  control manually on ground**
5. When using **rough airports**, long distance to the propeller causes **less damage due to loose objects to the turning wheel**
6. **Less damage to the airframe** when frequently used in **rough airports**
7. Easier to change to **ski-operations in winter**

**Shock absorbers:**

To **prevent landing shock damage** to the fuselage during heavy landings.

Four classes of shock absorbers:

| Class | Features |
| --- | --- |
| Low pressure tires | Often found on smaller aircrafts. It stores rather absorbs shock, therefore the plane may bounce back into the air. |
| Oleo | Practically in all modern planes, momentum dissipated by forcing oil (incompressible), from one side of the piston to the other side, through a small orifice. The shock is absorbed to force the displacement of the oil. In a simple oleo, an inner cylinder is attached to the fuselage and an outer cylinder is hinged with the wheel. The oil will not reposition until the next take-off therefore, the simple oleo only absorbs the shock of landing. To absorb shocks experienced during taxiing and taking-off, a spring or compressed air is added to the oleo to aid, referred as oleo-aerol, and oleo-pneumatic. |
| Rubber | Often in conjunction with oleo, in the form of rubber disk, doughnuts and shock cord.  |
| Spring steel | This type of landing gear described above. |

**Brakes:**

Brakes provide **quick deceleration** and **better on-ground control**.

Nearly all aircrafts use **disc brakes**, sandwiching **one** **rotating disc** by **two** **pucks**, operated by **hydraulic pressure**. One **fixed** (related to the disc) **puck** is called **anvil** (at the back side of the plate), the **moving** (stationary to the structure) **puck** is called **piston**.

![https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/disc%20brakes%20palne.jpg?raw=true](https://github.com/liuchen37/Pics/blob/main/disc%20brakes%20palne.jpg?raw=true)

When braking, **hydraulic** **pressure** **pushes** **hydraulic piston against the** **piston** **puck**, leads to **further pushing** **against the anvil puck** allowing braking forces (**friction**) form **both side** of the braking disc.

Disc brakes are reliable and henceforth, only a **50-hour interval visual inspection** is required. When the airplane is **unattended**, **parking brake** should be **disengaged**, and use **wheel chocks**. Since the rotation discs are made from steel, they may be **corroded** or **rusted**, if used infrequently.

Different braking system utilises **different types of hydraulic fluid**, and they should **not be mixed**. The hydraulic fluid should be kept **free from contamination** from dirt.
