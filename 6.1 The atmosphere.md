# 6.1 The atmosphere

The atmosphere is a mixture of invisible gases. At up to 250,000 feet (76.2 km, lower layer), it is composed by 78% of nitrogen, 21% of oxygen, and remainder including argon, water vapour, carbon dioxide and other impurities. **Water vapour and impurities present only in the lower layer.** The upper layers  has no particles to reflect light and henceforth appear deep cobalt and blue-black in colour.

A square inch (6.5 cm2) of air at sea level is ~14.7 lbs (6.67 kg), at 20,000 feet (6 km) , its ~6.75 lbs (3 kg).  The weight diminishes with altitude.

## 6.1.1 Properties of the atmosphere

Primary properties:

- Mobility
- Capacity for expansion
- Capacity for compression

**Air lifting** to level of decreased pressure (higher altitude), leads to **air expansion**. In expanding, it **cools**. When it achieves the **temperature of condensation**, clouds and participation forms.

## 6.1.2 Divisions of the atmosphere

Four distinct layers in ascending order:

1. The troposphere
2. The stratosphere
3. The mesosphere
4. The thermosphere
5. The exosphere

1. ***The troposphere / la troposphère / 对流层***

Range: from sea level to **28,000 feet (8.5 km) at the poles**, and **54,000 feet (16.5 km) at the equator**.

Most “weathers” occur in the troposphere due to the **presence of water vapour** and **vertical current** produced from the sun’s radiation from the earth surface. In the upper region, very strong, fast moving and complex wind occurs, called **jet streams**.

The top region of the troposphere is referred as the **tropopause**, marked by the temperature reduced to **-56 ºC**. After the tropopause, the **temperature** **reverses** and **begins to increase**. The height of the tropopause varies, based on latitude, and season.

2. ***The stratosphere / la stratosphère / 平流层***

Range: starts from **~50,000 feet (15.2 km)**. Commercial flights could fly in lower region of the stratosphere to avoid turbulence.

Air pressure continue to decrease and temperature raises gradually to **0 ºC remarks the start of the mesosphere**. In comparison to the troposphere, the stratosphere is **thicker over the poles** and **thinner over the equators**. An **ozone layer**  presents in this layer (66,000 ~ 131,000 feet; 20 km ~ 40km). It absorbs sun ultraviolet radiation and hence increase temperature.

The top region of the stratosphere is called the **stratopause** (up to **~5 ºC**). And **temperature reverses** and **begins to fall**.

3. ***The mesosphere / la mésosphère / 中间层***

The mesosphere starts by a **significant drop in temperature** that is carried through from the stratosphere. **Meteorites burn up** in this layer when entering the atmosphere.

The top region of the mesosphere is called the **mesopause**, marker by the temperature of -**100 ºC** and **temperature begins to increase** with higher altitude. It is the **coldest** **region** in earth atmosphere due to lack of solar heating and excess carbon dioxide radiative cooling.

4. ***The thermosphere / la thermosphère / 增温层***

Starts from **~80 km** above sea level, the thickness depends on solar activity (250 km to 500 km). The thermosphere absorbs much of the **solar radiation** therefore causing **continuous increase in temperature**. 

The **Kámán line** is an imaginary border by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) of the earth atmosphere and outer space, at **~100 km**.

Aurora begins from the top of the thermosphere, to the exosphere. Air molecules ionise due to solar radiation, ions and electrons form an **ionosphere**. The ionosphere has the capability to reflect radio wave and therefore used as **remote radio communication**.

5. ***The exosphere / l’exosphère / 外逸层***

Air pressure in this layer drops to **nearly vacuum**. Under this condition, the **temperature (>~0 ºC) plays little roles** and commonly replaced by the definition of **energy states of individual molecules**. As in vacuum state, no particles can be employed to transfer heat. Apart from the karman line, the boundary of space is hard to define. 

In outer space, temperature may rise up to 3,000 ºC at 600 km, under solar radiation.

## 6.1.3 Standard atmosphere

Due to aeronautic needs, a standard atmosphere (slightly different to real conditions) has been created:

The **International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard atmosphere** for the continent of North America, based on summer and winter average at latitude 40º, assumes the following conditions:

- Perfectly dry gas
- Sea level pressure at 29.92 inches Hg(1013 Pa)
- Sea level temperature at 15 ºC
- Rate of temperature descending is 1.98 ºC/1,000 feet.
